====================================================================

PRVC mode :									
									1)Pressure Regulated Volume Control mode will give set tidal volume with optimal constant pressure
									2)This mode give two volume control breaths and measure pplateau pressure, and this pressure will be the set pressure for the prvc mode.
									3)If any pressure drop occurs also it start with new volume contoll mode breaths.
									4)The volume will reach to set tidal volume by adjusting the pressure.
									5)The change pressure is identified by calculating complaince of the lungs.
									6)The complaince is the average of consecutive five breaths.
									7)The pressure change  is the ratio of volume error and measured complaince.
Preuse check :
									1)Preuse check is the list of continuos test on ventilator before going to ventilation.
									2)In this ventilator it include eight tests from different board.
									3)The preuse check is defined as 9th mode in tha ventilator.
									4)A write register is used for preusecheck, through this register DU is communicating with controller.
									5)A status register bit also used in the logic,which will inform the DU after each test.The register name is "puc_update".
									6)Each test has 5 sec delay except o2 sensor and pressure sensor check.
Patient circuit test:
									1)This is also part of ventilator test which mainly concern about the breathing circuit of the ventilator.
									2)The test also include as 10th mode of the ventilator.
									3)The results will calculated by the DU(Complaince and Resistance of the breathing circuit)
Self Diagnostics:					
									1)Self Diagnostics is the sequence of test for the working of ventilator.
									2)DU will put queris to get the read registter from different board.
									3)This function will run under diagnostics section  of the code.
Medical Procedure :					
									1)Medical Procedure includes three functions Inspiratory hold,Expiratory hold and manual Breath.
									2)Two write registers are defined for this functionality "Med_Proc" and "Hold time".
									3)Med_Proc will hold the function to be performed and Hold time will give working time for each function.
									4)This function will run in every 1ms intervel.

====================================================================

Self Diagnostics:	
									1)All read register can access by the DU by sending queries.
							
Modifications _Power_Board
====================================================================

Battery Mangaement System:
									1)The power is communcating with battery and bms through I2C communication.
									2)The board is getting data from the BMS in every 100ms and storing in a register.
									3)Battery related alarm are generated from these datas.
									4)The alarms will attach to the status register and sending to Du with an intervel of 1s.
									5)Along with the status register batterry percentage also sending to DU.
Self Diagnostics:
									1)1)All read register can access by the DU by sending queries.
